# [/Uses](https://uses.tech/)

Apparently, it's popular among Dev Bloggers to make a blog about what software and hardware they use, since I'm trying to reach my quota of two whole blogs a month I'll do one.  Even though mine won't be as lucrative or flex about my dank setup as the others it'll show what a poor man uses to make websites.

## Software

### Operating Systems

- __[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)__
    
This is the main OS I use to do a majority of my web development, and coding.  It's pretty nice, occasionally it gives me problems which I have to spend half a day learning how to fix.

- __[Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-10)__

I'm dual booting with Windows being the main OS on my laptop.  It's nice since I use it to run most of games and streams.  I occasionally use it for development, but it's pretty lackluster compared to Ubuntu.

---

### Coding

- __[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)__

This is what I mainly use to create my blogs and code.  I never had any issues with it, it has a tons of extensions to customize it, and it's free.

- __[Github](https://github.com/DanielOhn)__
  
Use it to keep most of my code and fill out the issues on how I want to improve my projects.  It's more a website than software, but I use it daily to keep track of my own progress.

- __Terminal/[Cmder](https://cmder.net/)__

Cmder is used whenever I want to code on Windows.  Terminal is the best command line hands down, no contest.

---

### Others

- __[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)__

I use this browser for everything and always liked it better than Chrome.  The only time I use other browsers is when I want to check my websites and projects on them.

- __[Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/GreatxCatsby/)__
  
I hardly play games anymore, but when I do I like to look at my huge backlog of games on steam I'll never play and get depressed.

- __[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0BGhhLl1vXjSj8LwUeXVEH?si=YcDLDSb2S7euLrbOpIG4Aw)__
  
I use this for all my music needs and lately been getting into podcasts so I've been using it for that as well.

- __[Discord](https://discordapp.com/) (Nutsby#3777)__

What I mainly use to talk to other devs and my friends.

- __White Board__
  
Not actual software.  I just use paper and a white board for most of my designs and keep track of stuff I wanna complete in each day.

## Hardware

- __[Lenovo IdeaPad L340](https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Performance-Dual-Core-802-11ac-Bluetooth/dp/B07Q147J19/ref=sr_1_4/?_encoding=UTF8&keywords=lenovo%20ideapad%20L340&qid=1582330239&sr=8-4&ref_=nav_ya_signin&)__

I picked up this laptop for pretty reasonable price after my desktop went out.  It's been working really well and I haven't had much issues with it.  My only main complaint is that the keys are spaced apart too much for my liking, but I got used to it quickly.

- __[Logitech G230 Wired Headset](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Stereo-Gaming-Headset-Cable/dp/B00BFOEY4I/ref=pd_sbs_147_t_0/143-2264408-3556755?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00BFOEY4I&pd_rd_r=7193883d-6b56-4a94-992f-224c7711d71c&pd_rd_w=zKFp2&pd_rd_wg=g2bHD&pf_rd_p=5cfcfe89-300f-47d2-b1ad-a4e27203a02a&pf_rd_r=828EKYG3GMHP5XDY1FS5&psc=1&refRID=828EKYG3GMHP5XDY1FS5)__

Picked up this headset a few years back for $40 bucks.  Been using it daily whenever I'm on the computer.  It has great sound quality and a good mic.  My main issue with it is that the plastic holding the sides of the headset is cheap and breaks easily.

- __[Onn Optical Mouse](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Onn-Standard-3D-Optical-Mouse-With-Scroll-Wheel-Black/16794997)__

I've been using this mouse for years, I think I got it for like 5 bucks at Big Lots.  It's wired and not really impressive, it just does its job.
